## Description

Welcome to the Stock Prediction Model using LSTM repository! This project utilizes deep learning techniques to predict stock prices. Specifically, it employs the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture to make future stock price predictions based on historical data.

## Features

- LSTM-based stock price prediction model.
- Preprocessing and feature engineering for financial data.
- Training and testing the model.
- Visualizations and analysis of results.
- Easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data.py`: Data preprocessing and preparation script.
- `model.py`: LSTM model training and prediction script.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `data.py` script to preprocess and prepare the data.
4. Run the `model.py` script to train and evaluate the LSTM model.

## Usage

Detailed usage instructions and examples can be found in the Jupyter notebooks located in the `notebooks/` directory.
